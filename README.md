## 🧹Data Cleaning & Validation
### 🔎 Initial Data Assessment

During data validation, **501 fully empty rows** were identified.
These rows were introduced during the CSV import process and contained NULL values across all critical business columns.



### 🛠 Cleaning Steps Performed

**1.** Measured total row count before cleaning

**2.** Identified fully empty rows using NULL validation

**3.** Created a cleaned dataset excluding invalid records

**4.** Validated row count after cleaning to ensure accuracy



### ✅ Validation Results

- Total Rows Before Cleaning: **32985**

- Fully Empty Rows Identified: **501**

- Total Rows After Cleaning: **32484**

- Rows Removed: **501**

- Analysis performed on cleaned dataset (*Superstore_Cleaned*)
